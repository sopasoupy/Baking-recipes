## Steps

### Détrempe (Dough)
1. **24 Hours Before Serving:** Combine flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in a stand mixer. Add water and milk, and mix on low speed for 5 minutes until a smooth dough forms. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.
2. Add butter and mix on medium-low speed until smooth and stretchy (8-10 minutes). Form into a ball, make two deep slashes, and let rise at room temperature for 45-60 minutes. Refrigerate for 4-12 hours.

### Butter Block
3. Flatten chilled butter into an 20cm x 20cm (14cm x 14cm for 4 croissants) square between parchment sheets. Chill until firm but pliable.

### Laminating the Dough
4. Deflate the chilled dough, roll into an 20cm square (14cm for 4 croissants), and freeze for 20 minutes. Roll dough into a 40cm x 20cm (28cm * 14cm for 4 croissants) rectangle and encase the butter block. Roll to 60cm x 20cm (42cm * 14cm for 4 croissants), fold into a "book" (4 layers), and chill.
5. Repeat rolling and folding for a simple turn (3 layers). Chill and rest dough overnight.

### Shaping Croissants
6. Roll dough into a 43cm * 35cm (30cm * 25cm for 4 croissants) rectangle, trim edges, and cut into 8 triangles. Shape each triangle into a crescent by rolling from the wide end to the tip.

### Proofing
7. Proof croissants at RT. Chill for 20 minutes before baking.

### Baking
8. Preheat oven to 190°C. Brush croissants with yolk-cream mixture and bake for 20 minutes, then rotate pans and bake another 10-15 minutes until deeply browned. Cool completely.
